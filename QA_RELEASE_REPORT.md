## Known Issues

### Critical Issues: 0
None

### Non-Critical Issues: 1

- **Suggested fix**: Review test environment setup for API verification

## Test Evidence

### Rate Limiting Test
```
Manual browser testing confirmed:
- Multiple rapid API calls trigger 429 responses ✅
- Rate limiting active and working ✅
```

### Verified Transactions (Mock Mode)

- Status: Verified ✅
- Amount: Mock SOL values ✅
- Memo: Proper JSON format ✅
```
