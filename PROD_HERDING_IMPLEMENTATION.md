# Prod-Herding Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive production safety measures before canary rollout of Actions feature.

## 1. Feature Flags (✅ Completed)

### Environment-based Flags
- **ACTIONS**: OFF in production, ON in staging/dev
- **EMBED_INTENT**: OFF in production, ON in staging/dev
- Strict enforcement: `!isProduction` check added

### Files Modified
- `app/lib/flags.ts`: Updated flag logic to strictly disable Actions in production

## 2. Geofencing + ToS Acceptance (✅ Completed)

### Geofencing Service
- **Blocked Countries**: US, CN, IN, RU, IR, KP, CU, SY
- **Blocked US States**: NY, TX, CA
- **Location Detection**: Mock service (replace with real service in production)
- **IP-based Validation**: Client IP extraction from headers

### ToS Acceptance
- **Version Management**: Current version 1.0.0
- **Acceptance Tracking**: In-memory storage (replace with DB in production)
- **Required Before Actions**: Must accept ToS before trading

### Files Created
- `app/lib/geofencing.ts`: Core geofencing and ToS logic
- `app/api/tos/accept/route.ts`: ToS acceptance API
- `app/components/actions/ToSAcceptance.tsx`: ToS UI component

## 3. Webhook Security (✅ Completed)

### HTTPS Enforcement
- **Production Only**: HTTPS required in production
- **Private IP Blocking**: Localhost/private IPs blocked in production
- **URL Validation**: Comprehensive URL format validation

### HMAC Signing
- **SHA-256 HMAC**: All webhook payloads signed
- **Signature Verification**: Timing-safe comparison
- **Header-based**: `X-Predikt-Signature` header

### Files Modified
- `app/lib/webhook-security.ts`: Enhanced with strict production rules

## 4. Kill-Switch Implementation (✅ Completed)

### Kill-Switch Service
- **Operation Scoping**: all, execute, simulate, create
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Critical issue handling
- **Health Monitoring**: Uptime and status tracking
- **Admin Controls**: Activate/deactivate via API

### Server-side Checks
- **Execute API**: Kill-switch check before execution
- **Status 503**: Service unavailable when active
- **Reason Logging**: Detailed activation reasons

### Files Created
- `app/lib/kill-switch.ts`: Core kill-switch logic
- `app/api/admin/kill-switch/route.ts`: Admin API
- `app/components/actions/KillSwitchStatus.tsx`: UI component
- `app/api/intents/execute/route.ts`: Updated with kill-switch check

## 5. UI Integration (✅ Completed)

### Actions Page Updates
- **Kill-Switch Status**: Real-time status display
- **ToS Acceptance**: Required before trading
- **Admin Controls**: Activate/deactivate buttons
- **Error Handling**: Clear user feedback

### Component Features
- **Real-time Updates**: Status polling
- **Admin Interface**: Emergency controls
- **User Guidance**: Clear instructions

## 6. Testing Results (✅ Verified)

### API Endpoints Tested
```bash
# Kill-switch status
GET /api/admin/kill-switch ✅

# ToS acceptance
GET /api/tos/accept?userId=test-user ✅
POST /api/tos/accept ✅

# Kill-switch activation
POST /api/admin/kill-switch (activate) ✅
POST /api/admin/kill-switch (deactivate) ✅

# Execute blocking
POST /api/intents/execute (with kill-switch active) ✅
```

### Test Results
- ✅ Kill-switch activation/deactivation works
- ✅ ToS acceptance flow works
- ✅ Execute API properly blocked when kill-switch active
- ✅ Geofencing mock service works
- ✅ UI components render correctly

## 7. Production Readiness

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Feature flags
NODE_ENV=production
FEATURE_ACTIONS=false
FEATURE_EMBED_INTENT=false

# Webhook security
WEBHOOK_HMAC_SECRET=your-secret-key

# Geolocation service (replace mock)
GEOIP_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### Database Requirements
- ToS acceptance records (currently in-memory)
- Kill-switch audit log (currently console)
- Webhook delivery tracking (currently console)

### Monitoring
- Kill-switch health checks
- ToS acceptance rates
- Webhook delivery success rates
- Geographic access patterns

## 8. Security Considerations

### Implemented Safeguards
- ✅ Geographic restrictions
- ✅ Terms of Service enforcement
- ✅ HTTPS-only webhooks
- ✅ HMAC payload signing
- ✅ Emergency kill-switch
- ✅ Admin authentication (placeholder)

### Production Recommendations
- Replace mock geolocation with real service
- Implement proper admin authentication
- Add database persistence for ToS/kill-switch
- Set up monitoring alerts
- Regular security audits

## 9. Next Steps

### Before Canary Rollout
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Test all safety measures
3. Configure real geolocation service
4. Set up monitoring dashboards
5. Train admin team on kill-switch usage

### Canary Rollout
1. Enable for 10% of users via cookie
2. Monitor error rates and performance
3. Gradually increase to 50%, then 100%
4. Keep kill-switch ready for emergency shutdown

## 10. Files Summary
