# Feed Loading Performance Fix

## Problem

The feed page was showing "Loading insights..." for too long, blocking the entire UI even when local data was available.

## Root Cause

1. UI was completely blocked when `loading = true`, even if local/cached data existed
2. No timeout mechanism for slow API requests
3. No fallback data to show while loading

## Changes Made

### 1. Feed Page UI Logic (`app/feed/page.tsx`)

- **Non-blocking render**: Show content immediately if any items are available, regardless of loading state
- **Skeleton only when empty**: Loading skeleton only appears when `loading && visible.length === 0`
- **Demo data fallback**: If loading takes too long with no data, show demo insights
- **Inline loading indicator**: Small "Updating feed..." shown when refreshing with existing content
- **Aggressive timeout**: API timeout reduced to 3 seconds for faster feedback

### 2. Fetch Hook Improvements (`app/hooks/useOptimizedFetch.ts`)

- **Request timeout**: Default 5-second timeout with abort mechanism
- **Safety timeout**: Force loading to false after 7 seconds maximum
- **Graceful degradation**: Keep cached data when requests timeout
- **Better error handling**: Show timeout errors instead of infinite loading

### 3. Debug Logging

- Added detailed console logging to help diagnose loading issues
- Shows API URL, data counts, loading states, and errors

## Testing

```bash
# Test the API directly (should respond quickly)
curl -s -m 10 "http://localhost:3000/api/feed?limit=5&category=all"

# Refresh the feed page and check browser console for debug logs
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **Immediate render**: Local items show instantly
2. **Fast API response**: Server data loads within 3 seconds
3. **Timeout protection**: No infinite spinners - max 7 seconds loading
4. **Fallback content**: Demo data shown if API is slow and no cache exists
5. **Background updates**: New data loads without blocking existing content

## Next Steps

If issues persist:

1. Check browser console for debug logs
2. Verify API response times
3. Consider database indexing if API is consistently slow
4. Add retry mechanisms for failed requests
