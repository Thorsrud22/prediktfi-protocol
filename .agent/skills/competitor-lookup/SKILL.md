# Competitor Lookup Skill

Follow this ritual when analyzing competitors for a crypto or SaaS project.

## 1. Discovery Phase
First, identify the **Sector** (e.g., DeFi, AI Agent, RWA).
Then, run searches for the specific "Titans" of that sector:
- **For SaaS**: Search 'FounderDating', 'CoFoundersLab', 'ProductHunt'.
- **For Crypto**: Search 'DefiLlama', 'CoinGecko', 'Dune Analytics'.

## 2. Extraction Protocol
For each competitor found, extract these 3 "Hard Signals":
1.  **Traction**: TVL, Daily Active Users (DAU), or Revenue.
2.  **Funding**: Total raised, lead investors (look for Tier 1 VCs).
3.  **Positioning**: What is their one-liner value prop?

## 3. Formatting
Present the findings in a table:

| Competitor | Traction 📈 | Funding 💰 | Positioning 🎯 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Name* | *$TVL / Users* | *$Raised* | *One-liner* |

## 4. Verification
Before finalizing, ensure the links are valid.
