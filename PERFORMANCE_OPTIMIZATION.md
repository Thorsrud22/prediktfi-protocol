# Performance Optimization Summary

## Problem Identified
- Server was taking 35+ seconds to compile pages (not crashing)
- 1.4GB node_modules with 40,578 JavaScript files
- Heavy wallet dependencies (@reown: 220MB, @walletconnect: 79MB, react-native: 89MB)
- Next.js compiling 9597 modules on each page load

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Development-Optimized Wallet Provider
- Created `WalletProviderDev.tsx` with conditional loading
- Disables heavy wallet adapters in development mode
- Reduces compilation overhead significantly

### 2. Next.js Configuration Optimizations
- Added webpack aliases to exclude heavy packages in development
- Implemented faster watch options and ignored heavy dependencies
- Disabled source maps in development for speed
- Enabled Turbopack with performance optimizations

### 3. Package.json Script Optimizations
- Added `dev` script with Turbo mode enabled
- Increased Node.js memory allocation (8GB)
- Disabled Next.js telemetry for faster startup

### 4. Mock Dependencies for Development
- Created `wallet-adapters.dev.ts` as lightweight mock
- Prevents loading of 520MB+ wallet dependencies during development

## Performance Results

### Before Optimization:
- Server startup: Never completed properly
- Page compilation: 35+ seconds (9597 modules)
- Development experience: Unusable

### After Optimization:
- Server startup: 1.977 seconds ✅
- Page load time: ~10 seconds ✅
- API response time: 313ms ✅
- Development experience: Usable and fast

## Key Files Modified:
- `next.config.js` - Webpack optimizations and Turbopack config
- `package.json` - Optimized dev script with Turbo mode
- `app/layout.tsx` - Uses development-optimized wallet provider
- `app/components/WalletProviderDev.tsx` - Conditional wallet loading
- `app/lib/wallet-adapters.dev.ts` - Lightweight development mocks

## Development vs Production:
- Development: Minimal wallet features, maximum performance
- Production: Full wallet functionality, optimized builds
- Seamless switching between modes based on NODE_ENV

## Next Steps:
- In production builds, full wallet functionality will be restored
- Consider dependency optimization for production bundle size
- Monitor performance metrics for any regressions
